    "intro": "Smart Garden supports 6 pre-programmed irrigation zones, each dedicated to a group of plants with similar water needs — for example, succulents, vegetables, or flowers.",
    "patternsTitle": "Within each zone, you can choose from three flexible watering patterns:",
    "pattern1": {
      "title": "Moisture-based adaptive pattern",
      "text": "Configure the system to water until a desired soil moisture level is reached, and define a dry period between watering sessions. You can set up seasonal or phase-based cycles to adapt the watering behavior throughout the year, according to your plants' needs."
    },
    "pattern2": {
      "title": "Periodic watering with moisture cap",
      "text": "Set a schedule that waters the plants every X days, but only up to a defined maximum moisture level — perfect for gardens where precise hydration is important, but less real-time data is needed."
    },
    "pattern3": {
      "title": "Simple time-based pattern",
      "text": "Choose how often and how long to water — for example, 10 minutes every 3 days. This basic mode works well for hardy plants or general maintenance."
    },
    "manual": "Additionally, every zone supports manual watering, allowing you to trigger irrigation instantly until the target moisture level is reached.",
    "wireless": "In large gardens, wireless soil sensors communicate over Wi-Fi with the main control unit and are self-powered through energy harvesting or long-life batteries."
